# Cornell Hyperloop - Electrical Team Repository

This repository contains the electrical team's code, documentation, and resources for the Cornell Hyperloop project.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The repository has been reorganized into a clean, scalable structure with four main directories:

### 📱 `GUI/` - Active User Interface
**Current Dash-based web application for sensor monitoring and control**
- **Technology**: Python Dash with Bootstrap components
- **Purpose**: Real-time sensor dashboard with modular architecture
- **Key Features**: 
  - Dynamic tab management
  - Real-time sensor data visualization
  - Modular sensor cards
  - Emergency controls
- **Setup**: See `GUI/README.md` for detailed setup instructions
- **Status**: ✅ Active development

### 📚 `documentation/` - Project Documentation
**All current documentation, diagrams, and technical specs**
- `Diagrams/` - System architecture and wiring diagrams
- `docs/` - Technical documentation
- PDF documents and specifications
- **Status**: ✅ Current documentation

### ⚠️ `depreciated/` - Legacy Code (Preserved for Reference)
**Older implementations that are no longer actively maintained**
- `Communications/` - ZCM communication protocol implementation
- `Sensors/` - Legacy sensor libraries and Arduino code
- `State_Estimation/` - State machine and estimation algorithms
- `Old/` - Previous software versions and implementations
- `zcm testing/` - Communication protocol testing
- **Status**: 🔄 Preserved for reference, not actively maintained

### 🗄️ `archived_resources/` - Historical Resources
**Legacy web interfaces and learning materials**
- `Website/` - Previous React-based web interface
- `WebsiteTemplate/` - React template and components
- `Workshop/` - Tutorial and learning code
- **Status**: 📦 Archived for historical reference

## 🚀 Quick Start

### New Team Members (Docker - Recommended)
**Fully automated setup - just run one command:**

```bash
cd GUI/docker
./start.bat     # Windows
./start.sh      # macOS/Linux
```

This will automatically:
- ✅ Build the Docker container
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Start the dashboard at `http://localhost:8050`

**See `GUI/docker/README.md` for detailed Docker setup guide.**

### Alternative: Python Virtual Environment (Legacy)
```bash
cd GUI
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Current Team Members
* **Aislinn Ennis**Electrical Lead
* **Weston Clark**: ECC Leads  
* **Lalo Esparza**: Power Systems Lead

#### ECC Team
* Weston Clark, Jordan Zeiger, Prayga Babbar
#### Power Systems Team  
* Lalo Esparza, Tribeca Kao

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
- **GUI Components**: Add to `GUI/` following the modular architecture
- **Documentation**: Add to `documentation/` with clear organization
- **Testing**: Include appropriate tests for new functionality

### Working with Legacy Code
- **Reference Only**: Code in `depreciated/` should only be referenced, not modified
- **Migration**: When updating legacy features, implement in `GUI/` or appropriate active directory
- **Documentation**: Update documentation when migrating functionality

## 📋 Project Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| GUI Dashboard | ✅ Active | Modern Dash-based interface |
| Sensor Integration | 🔄 In Progress | Migrating from legacy implementations |
| Communication Protocol | ⚠️ Legacy | ZCM implementation in depreciated/ |
| Documentation | ✅ Current | Organized in documentation/ |

## 🔧 Technology Stack

**Current Active Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Python Dash, Dash Bootstrap Components, Plotly
- **Communication**: PySerial, ZCM (legacy)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready (see `GUI/Dockerfile`)

**Legacy Stack (Preserved):**
- **Previous GUI**: PyQt5, PyQtGraph
- **Web Interface**: React, JavaScript
- **Embedded**: Arduino, C/C++

## 📖 Getting Help

1. **Current Development**: Check `GUI/README.md` for detailed setup and development guides
2. **Architecture Questions**: Review `documentation/` for system diagrams and specs  
3. **Legacy Reference**: Browse `depreciated/` for historical implementations
4. **Team Communication**: Contact team leads for project-specific questions

## 🤝 Contributing

1. **New Features**: Implement in `GUI/` following the modular architecture
2. **Documentation**: Update `documentation/` for any architectural changes
3. **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
4. **Legacy Code**: Do not modify code in `depreciated/` or `archived_resources/`

## 📝 Migration Notes

This repository was restructured in October 2025 to improve maintainability and scalability:

- **Moved Active Code**: NEW_GUI → GUI (current development focus)
- **Preserved Legacy**: Old implementations moved to depreciated/ for reference
- **Organized Documentation**: Centralized in documentation/ folder
- **Archived Resources**: Historical web interfaces preserved in archived_resources/

For questions about the restructuring or location of specific files, please contact the electrical team leads.
