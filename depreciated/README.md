# Depreciated Code Directory

This directory contains legacy code and implementations that are no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference and historical purposes.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**DO NOT MODIFY CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY**

This code is preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding previous implementations
- Migration guidance when updating features
- Troubleshooting legacy system issues

## Migration Guidelines

When updating functionality that exists in this directory:

1. **Reference**: Use this code as reference for understanding requirements
2. **Implement**: Create new implementations in appropriate active directories
3. **Document**: Document any changes or improvements made
4. **Test**: Ensure new implementations meet or exceed legacy functionality

## Technology Stack (Legacy)

- **Languages**: C/C++, Python
- **Communication**: ZCM, Serial communication
- **Hardware**: Arduino, various sensors
- **GUI**: PyQt5, PyQtGraph
