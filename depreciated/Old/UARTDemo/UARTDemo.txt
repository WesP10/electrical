UART Demo Folder:

In this folder, there are three different Arduino sketches:
	sender
	receiver
	*IGNORE senderwsensor for now*

For the purposes of the demo, the receiver sketch should be uploaded to the Arduino Mega and one of the other two sketches can be uploaded to an Arduino Uno. The purpose of this demo is to communicate between two Arduino using UART as a test-of-concept for using UART communication later on between the Arduino Mega and the Beaglebone Black. The only difference between the other two sketches, sender and senderwsensor, is the the former simply sends a message to the other Arduino, and the latter sends a the value of that the analog short range sensor is reading. 

The wiring for this should be as follows: on the Arduino Mega, there should be a wire going from pin 19 to pin 1 on the Arduino Uno, and then a wire from pin 20 on the Arduino Mega to pin 0 on the Arduino Uno. There is also a picture of this wiring included in the picture folder ONLY THE ARDUINO MEGA SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE COMPUTER THROUGH SERIAL PORT. The analog short range sensor should also be connected to the Arduino Uno by the schematic also included in the picture folder.

This demo should result in the serial monitor of the computer (pulled up in the receiver sketch window) having the value of i continuously printed when the sender is uploaded to the Uno. *There is currently an issue I need to ask Daniel about trying to match up the delays. Since there is no delay, some values of i are not printed.*
