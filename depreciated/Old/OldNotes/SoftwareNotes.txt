Tasks for upcoming weeks:

- Create Github repo DONE
	- Entire subteam or only software? --> Separate folders 
	- public or CMail (private)? --> Private with COE 
	- create organizational tree

- Assign one person to a sensor
	- create a function to read sensor value - Store as local variable
	- research into UART connection with Arduino
	- create a function to return whether sensor values are normal or worrisome - Store as local variable
	- How does UART return each of the sensor values (what kind of data structure)? --> Can be manipulated 
	- Look at Arduino code for sensor data organization

- Create design for GUI
	- include all sensor values, easy to read 
	- group sensor readings for same attribute but diff sensors together
	- decide when a margin of error between diff sensors for same attribute is worrisome and visually display warning
	- display warning when sensor values indicate trouble
	- Include E-brake??? --> For now create LED control 
	- For WebDev: web version of GUI, less sensor readings, more visuals, show Pod progress and position in pod, no E-brake
		- pass along local variables to WebDev for manipulation

- After design and functions are complete
	- Work with subteam to make GUI 
	- Sync debug with BBB to upload code 	
	- Test with sensors and connection to Arduino


Sensor Assignments:

IMU: Manvith + Kenny
Short Range Sensor: Sid + Sameer, Jake (other short range)
Long Distance: Shadman + Justin
Photoelectric Sensor: Akira + Katarina

TODO (Software):

Due 3/13/18: Write a function in C input: Float output: true if okay false if problematic value
Due 3/25/18: Write a function to blink LED by running script on BBB terminal + be ready to demo
Due 4/10/18: Communicate between BBB and Base Station: BBB sends info back that is displayed
	- Listens for GPIO input
	- Passes it to the appropriate check function (assume a different flag is passed for each sensor)
	- Sends function value to the Base Station
	- Base station displays: "The reading from ____ is ____ and this is problematic/ non problematic
Due TBD: Design and implement GUI to display sensor values
	- Displays critical sensor readings and groups same data categories together (redundancies)
	- Decide on design of GUI and which libraries will be useful - DUE 4/22/18
Due 4/29/18: Transfer data between two computers using a web socket
	- Research implementation of ports and web sockets - DUE 4/24/18
